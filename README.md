# A quick breakdown on 2D character controllers 

Hi! I'm Dan and I want to use physics to make a good 2D character controller. I tried to learn from masters watching some tutorials covering this topic. Here, I'll also try to implement all the accessories like *coyote time* or *jump height*.

I hope this will be an helpfull study case! Let's dive in.

## Simple movement 

As shown in the interesting video [The ULTIMATE 2D Character CONTROLLER in UNITY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcw6nuc2uaU) (from Shinjingi) a way to make **horizontal movement** is to take track of a `desiredVelocity` vector and then interpolate the current velocity using an `acceleration` parameter.

```c#
// compute desiredVelocity vector
direction.X = input.RetriveMoveInput();
desiredVelocity = new Vector2(direction.X, 0f) * maxSpeed;

// accelerate towards desiredVelocity
acceleration = IsOnFloor() ? maxAcceleration : maxAirAcceleration;
maxSpeedChange = acceleration * (float)delta;
velocity.X = Mathf.MoveToward(velocity.X, desiredVelocity.X, maxSpeedChange);

// apply velocty to the character controller
Velocity = velocity;
```

## Jumping
To make a better jump we can use physics to calculate the time needed to reach the peak of the jump and the time needed to fall back. This allow us to model a non parabolic movement which (as stated in [Math for Game Programmers: Building a Better Jump](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hG9SzQxaCm8)) is more interesting for the player.

Following the guide [Making a Jump You Can Actually Use In Godot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOe1aGY6hXA) I learned that the jump can be split in three main elements

- üîù Jump Height
- üïõ Time To Peak
- üïß Time To Fall

We can model the gravity to depend on the y velocity. In fact we can say that if we are ascending, we calculate the gravity as 

`gravity = (-2.0 * JumpHeight) / TimeToPeak^2`

If we are falling we use

`gravity = (-2.0 * JumpHeight) / TimeToFall^2`

Here a written version of the video ([Physics for Game Dev ‚Äî A Platformer Physics Cheatsheet](https://medium.com/@brazmogu/physics-for-game-dev-a-platformer-physics-cheatsheet-f34b09064558#:~:text=Jump%20Height%20(and%20Velocity)&text=For%20that%2C%20we'll%20take,i.e.%20v%20%3D%20v'%2B%20gt))

## Jump buffering

Is a technique that allow us to buffer for a short period of time the next jump so the player will jump as soon as it touch the ground.

I have a `jumpRequest` variable and time limit

```
if (jumpBuffer)
{
	// jump buffering
  if (jumpBufferTime < jumpBufferLimit)
  {
  	jumpBufferTime += (float)delta;
  }
  else
  {
  	jumpBufferTime = 0.0f;
   jumpBuffer = false;
   return;
  }

  if (isOnFloor || jumpPhase < maxAirJumps)
  {
  	 jumpBuffer = false;
    jumpPhase += 1;
		currentVelocity.Y = -Mathf.Sqrt(2.0f * jumpHeight * gravity) / (float)delta;   
	}
}
```

## Variable jump height
For this to work I thought of how my system currenly works. Looking on how gravity depends on `TimeToPeak` and `TimeToFall`, I decided to use a counter to track jump height. If I release early the jump button, I'll switch  `TimeToPeak` with the current `heightCount`.

```
// change jumpGravity if released before reaching the peak
if (!isJumping && currentVelocity.Y < 0f) 
	jumpGravity = 2.0f * jumpHeight / (jumpHeightCount * timeToPeak);
	
if (isJumping)
{
	if (jumpHeightCount < timeToPeak) 
		jumpHeightCount += (float)delta;
	
	...
}
```

## Coyote time
Following the video [Coyote Time & Jump Buffering In Unity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFix_Kg2Di0), I managed to build a working coyote time! I starte with making a varibale `coyoteTimeCount` that counts time while in air. While this count is greater than 0 I can still jump.

While I'm still on ground I just set the count to the coyoteTime (I choose 0.2s).

```
// coyote time
coyoteTimeCount = isOnFloor ? coyoteTime : coyoteTimeCount - (float)delta; 
if (coyoteTimeCount <= 0f) jumpPhase = maxAirJumps;
```
